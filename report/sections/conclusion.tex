\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
The purpose of this project was to development an antenna to receive ADS-B signals from aircraft's on a CubeSat. A link budget was made and it showed that there was a need for a radiation-pattern that could compensate for the increased length in the reception due to the angle of the earth. Another important requirement for the antenna was that it should be circular-polarized since the received signal was linear polarized but the angle of reception was not known. A reflector antenna, a quadrifilar helical antenna and a hemispherical antenna was investigated. None of these antenna could overcome those requirements in their basic forms and modifications to these was investigated. The reflector antenna had a high gain in one single direction and a large size compared to the wavelength which made it difficult to use on a CubeSat. The quadrifilar helical antenna showed that is was difficult to change in its radiation-pattern due to the common design and still keep it circular polarized. The hemispherical helical antenna was modified to have four arms and a stretched structure which showed good performance, but this design had no gain in the center. This could be improved by changing the feeding point, but this introduced a non-symmetry which made the antenna to become non circular polarized.
