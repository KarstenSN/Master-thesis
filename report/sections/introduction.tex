CubeSats has gained more attention in recent years because of their low cost alternative for various purposes such
as education, communication, earth and space observations, etc. A CubeSat is made up of multiples of 10x10x10cm cubic units. A CubeSat made up of one unit is refered to as a 1U CubeSat and two units a 2U Cubesat. A CubeSat have a mass of no more than 1.33kg per unit. \citep{CalPol13} As the increased attention to CubeSats the antenna has also attracted more attention. Since the strict requirement for weight and size antennas for lower frequencies < 2GHz must therefore often be stowed when launched and unfolded when in space.     

Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) is used of air planes to transmit their identity and location obtained by GPS. In this project antennas that can fit these requirements will be investigated.
