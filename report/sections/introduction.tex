\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

This master thesis is aiming at the linearization of Power amplifiers with the presence of cross talk in antenna arrays. The tasks include  - the characterization of the cross talk and its impact on the system linearity
- digital pre-distrotion of PAs under effects of antenna cross talks. The project is motivated by the quickly growing need from the mobile communication industry, where highly integrated beam-steerable arrays consisting of a big number of power amplifiers and antenna elements are considered as the solution for higher data rates desired in emerging applications such as self-driving cars, remote e-health etc. There will be use DPD techniques that can capture the total nonlinearity of the whole array including the PAs and antenna elements. The special focus is to reduce the system complexity, while maintaining the linearisation performance. 

This project will be conducted in a way combining mainly measurements together with computaion in MATLAB
