\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
The goal of this project is to make an deployable antenna for Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) on a Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite.
ADS-B is a system in which aircraft continually transmit their identity and GPS-derived navigational information. ADS-B networks for air traffic monitoring have already been implemented in areas around the world, but ground stations cannot be installed in mid-ocean and are difficult to maintain in the Arctic, leaving a coverage gap for oceanic and high latitude airspace. Therefore a solution can be to monitor the signals with a low orbit satellite using an antenna matched to the frequencies of the ADS-B. This has already been done by the company Aireon which has 66 ADS-B receivers hosted on the new Iridium NEXT LEO satellite constellation. But this is a large satellite and a CubeSat would be better suited for the application.   
Therefore the antenna should fit in a 1U cubesat which can be deployed when in space.
