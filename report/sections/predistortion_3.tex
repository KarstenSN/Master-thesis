\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:pre_cons} the consept of Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD) is depicted. DPD is a way to "distort" the incomming signal with the inverse transfer-function of the amplifier. For example the gain of the amplifier is ideally linear in the small-signal region and gets non-linear at higher signal levels. To overcome this, a block called the predistorter inverses this non-linear curve which is the exact inverse of the PA, then a linear amplification can be achieved at the final PA output. But to archive this inverse of the PA all the non-linear effects has to be accounted for including memory effects. To do that several models has been proposed \citep{morgan2006}.

\section{DPD models}


\subsubsection{Weiner}
A simpel model to include memory effects is the Weiner model, which consists of a linear filter $h(m)$ followed by $a_k$ which is the polynomial coefficients of the non-linearity. The model is given by equation \ref{eq:wiener}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:wiener}
y_{wiener}(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} a_k [\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}h(m)x(n-m)]^k
\end{equation} 

It is seen that the output consists of the sum of the non-linear response multiplied with the sum of the input with the former input multiplied with a filter. The Weiner model is one of the simplest ways to combine memory effects with non-linearity but unfortunately it does not provide good results for modelling a power amplifier. 

 
\subsubsection{Hammerstein} 
Another simple model is the Hammerstein model which is given by equation \ref{eq:hammer}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:hammer}
y_{hammerstein}(n) = \sum_{m=0}^{M-1}g(m)\sum_{k=1}^{K}a_k x^k(n-m)
\end{equation} 

Which is formed by a non-linearity followed by a linear filter. It is seen that the output consist of the sum of the linear filter $g(m)$ multiplied with the sum of the filter coefficielts $a_k$ multiplied with the input signal and the former input signal in the power of $k$. 
Yet this filter is simple it does also have it's limitations when it come to modelling of power amplifiers. 
   
\subsubsection{Memory Polynomial}

A more used and general model is the memory polynomial given in equation \ref{eq:mempol}. The model is a deviation of the Hammerstein model which has proven effective for predistortion of actual power amplifiers under typical operations.   

\begin{equation}\label{eq:mempol}
y_{mp}(n) = \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} a_{km}x(n-m)|x(n-m)|^k
\end{equation}

where $a_{km}$ is the filter coefficients, $x(n)$ is the input, $M$ is the memory debt and $k$ is the envelope order.

\subsubsection{Estimation of coefficients}
A way to calculate the coefficients for a DPD algorithm is by use of the least-square-type algorithms. The reason for this is that the coefficients are linear weighting of non-linear signals. The easiest way to formulate such a problem is to first collect the coefficients into one $J \times 1$ vector denoted $\pmb{w}$, where $J$ is the total number of coefficients. The input can then further be assembled in to a vector denoted $\pmb{X}$ which dimensions is $N \times J$. The model output can then be expressed by: 

\begin{equation}
\pmb{\hat{y} = Xw}
\end{equation}  

where $\pmb{\hat{y}}$ is an $N \times 1$ vector which is an estimate of the real output $\pmb{y}$. The inverse of this model used for predistortion is then:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:x_est}
\pmb{\hat{x} = Yw}
\end{equation} 

where the input now is being estimated from the output samples. It is then possible to use the least-squares solution to minimize the estimation error:

\begin{equation}
\pmb{w = (Y^H Y)^{-1} Y^H x}
\end{equation} 

where $\pmb{Y}$ is a $J \times N$ matrix where $N$ is number of samples. The equation can further be rewritten as:

\begin{equation}
\pmb{Y^H Y w = Y^H x}
\end{equation}

This equation can easily be solved by MATLAB using the "backslash" operator ($\backslash$) by Cholesky decomposition and forward/backward substitution.   

\subsubsection{Estimation in MATLAB}
If an input and output signal is measured and imported into MATLAB and called $\pmb{x}$ and $\pmb{y}$ respectively, then a for-loop can do the $\pmb{Y}$ matrix. Next we need to remove M sampels from $\pmb{x}$ because of the time delay, then the substitution to find $\pmb{w}$ using the ($\backslash$) operator can be done.  The code is given below: 

\begin{lstlisting}[frame = single]
K = 5;%envelope order
M = 8;%memory debth

Y = [];%init matrix
for m = 1:M
    for k = 1:K
        Y(:,end+1) = (y(m:end-M+m).*abs(y(m:end-M+m)).^(k-1));
    end
end

w = Y\x(M:end);%Do the regression
x_est = Y*w;%estimated input
error = mean(abs(x(M:end)-x_est))

\end{lstlisting}

Now equation \ref{eq:x_est} must be used to obtain the inverse model:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame = single]
X = [];%init matrix
for m = 1:M
    for k = 1:K
        X(:,end+1) = (x(m:end-M+m).*abs(x(m:end-M+m)).^(k-1));
    end
end

x_inv = X*w;%inverse model
\end{lstlisting}


In figure \ref{fig:dpd_amam} a AM/AM plot is depicted of measurements done at an amplifier. The plot shows how the output (blue) is driven in its non-linear region. Then the inverse model (red) inverses this non-linearity and when this signal it presented at the input of the amplifier, then the response will become close to linear (yellow). The reason that it still reaches some level of compression is because of the limit of the supply-voltage to the amplifier. A PSD of the same measurements is depicted in figure \ref{fig:dpd_psd}. From that it is easy to see how the pre-distorted signal lowers the distortion. From figure \ref{fig:dpd_inout} a plot of the absolute value of the I and Q baseband values is depicted. It is clearly seen that the output is a non-linear response of the input and that the inverse model is compensating for the gain error.

\section{Crosstalk}
Crosstalk is coupling from one branch to another branch. When only a signal is present on a single branch, no crosstalk would appear to this branch. On the other hand if a signal is presented at two branches then crosstalk would appear to both of them. There exist three types of crosstalk which is: Crosstalk before the PA's, see figure \ref{fig:cross_bf}, Crosstalk after the PA's, see figure \ref{fig:cross_af} and Crosstalk on the antennas and mishmash due to coupling. Crosstalk before the PA is also called nonlinear since it is amplified by the non linear PA. It is is shown in \citep{islam2017} that the nonlinear crosstalk can be modelled as a pre-distorter denoted $\mu_k (.)$. The output from the PAs would become that of equation \ref{eq:nonlin}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:nonlin}
Y_{1k} = fk(uk(X_{11},X_{12},X_{13},X_{1k}))
\end{equation}   

Where X is the input signal, Y is the output and $fk$ is the PA response.

	\caption{Crosstalk before PA \citep{islam2017}}

  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.4\textwidth}

	\caption{Crosstalk after PA \citep{islam2017}}
    \label{fig:cross_af}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Crosstalk after the PA is called linear since it has an linear impact. In figure \ref{fig:cross_af} the output of the amplifier is connected to an isolator, which makes the output unaffected by reflections. A linear model can therefore be used which is shown in equation \ref{eq:lin_iso}. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:lin_iso}
Y_{1k} = \mu_k(f1(X_{11}),f2(X_{12}),f3(X_{13})..fk(X_{1k}))
\end{equation}     

When no isolators is presented the output will now be affected by the crosstalk or mutual-coupling between the antennas. A sketch of this is depicted in figure \ref{fig:cross_ant} where $a_{1k}$ is the incoming signal to the amplifier, $b_{2k}$ is the output from the amplifier and $a_{2k}$ is the reflected signal form the antenna array at the k'th branch \citep{Hausmair2017}. The relation between $a_{2k}$
and the output signals $b_{2k}$ is determined by the characteristics
of the antenna arrays S-parameters. The system model of the multi-antenna
transmitter can, therefore, be split in to a crosstalk and
mismatch model (CTMM). This block can further be used together with a dual-input-DPD which holds the model for the PA, to linearise the PA. See figure \ref{fig:cross_ctmm}. 


\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{figures/ch1/crosstalk_antenna}

  \hfill
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{figures/ch1/crosstalk_ctmm.png}
	\caption{The predistortion method consists of two main blocks: one linear CTMM block
for the whole transmitter and a dual-input DPD block in every transmit path. \citep{Hausmair2017}}
	\label{fig:cross_ctmm}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The CTMM describe the crosstalk and mishmash signals $a_{2k}$ as a function of the PA output $b_{2k}$. A mathematical model of this is shown in equation \ref{eq:ctmm}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ctmm}
 a_{2k} = \sum_{i=1}^{K} \lambda_{ki} b_{2i} = \boldsymbol{b}_2^T \boldsymbol{\lambda}_k
\end{equation}

Where $\boldsymbol{b}_2 = [b_{21},...,b_{2K}]^T$ are complex coefficients describing the input to the antenna and $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_k = [\lambda_{k1},...,\lambda_{kK}]^T$ are complex coefficients describing the reflection from the antenna, which also corresponds to S-parameters. The Dual-Input PA Model is then a function of the signals $a_{1k}$ and $a_{2k}$ which becomes a lengthy equation that is not further described here. The model can thou be found in \citep{Hausmair2017}. Its has been found that the approach is capable of reducing the ACPR of a measurement setup using 4-Tx antennas from -36.3dB to -50.7dB which is nearly distortion free. The problem with the model is thou that the S-parameters for the antennas has to be known and that the method needs feedback from each amplifier. This is a large problem if several amplifiers is used since it will increase complexity in the layout and also if the S-parameters cannot be measured it introduces an other problem. A solution to this problem can be to treat the amplifiers with antennas as one system and then do the DPD at the receiver side as depicted in figure \ref{fig:dpd_pdpd}. In order to make this configuration to work, the transmitter side has to send a pilot sequence to the receiver that is known for the receiver. Then the receiver can obtain the coefficients for the DPD algorithm and then do the estimation of the signal it self or it can transmit the DPD coefficients to the transmitter. The benefits with this approach is that also the channel is taken into account. Another problem that can be omitted with this approach is that when doing DPD in the conventional way, the amplifier has to act identical to the pre distorted signal that it did to the non-distorted which not always come true.

\label{fig:dpd_pdpd}
\end{figure}

To prove that this method could work is is necessary to make measurements at a setup with several PAs with antennas. If it is possible to measure a non predistorted signal with a receiver antenna connected to a spectrum analyser, import this signal into MATLAB and obtain a DPD model, generate a predistorted signal, send the predistorted signal to the amplifiers and measure a signal with no or little distortion at the Rx antanna. Then it is most likely that the method could work.
