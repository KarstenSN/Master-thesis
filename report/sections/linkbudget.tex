Typically in satellite communication a LOS component exist. Therefore the only obstacle between the satellite and user is the atmosphere and therefore the loss can be modelled as free space, with a limited variation due to weather conditions. ADS-B signal is sent through a linear polarized monopol with power varying from 75 W to 500 W depending of the airplane and speed \citep{FlyingLab}. The height of a low orbit satellite is between 600 km to 800 km. To calculate the power loss Friis Transmission Equation is used. It is assumed that the SNIR is minimum 9dB \citep{itu} 

\begin{equation}
\frac{P_r}{P_t} = (\frac{\lambda}{4\pi R})^2 G_t G_r|\vec{Pr}\cdot \vec{Pt}|^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
\end{equation}
Where $c = 3e8$ is speed of light in vaccum and $ f$ is the frequency in Hz. $|\vec{Pr}\cdot \vec{Pt}|^2$ denotes polarization mishmash. When solving for $f = 137MHz$ $R=800km$  $G_t = 0 dB$ and a polarization loss at 0, the free-space loss becomes 133.2dB.
